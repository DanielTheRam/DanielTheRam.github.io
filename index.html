      <h1> My journey how to become a tester</h1><br>
      <h3> Places where I studied so far:</h3>
      <h2> Khan Academy </h2>
      
      <p> So far this kind of project is a overlook of the basics of DevTools according the Khan Academy study materials. <br>
      More about the materials can be found at: <a href="https://cs.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/using-the-browser-developer-tools">Khan Academy</a> </p>
  
     <h2> NaucmeIT </h2>
     
     <p> There should be ment to say the materials on Khan Academy were recommended at <a href="https://naucme.it/">NaucmeIt</a>. At this website I proceed further in the tester course. <br>
       Both webpages provide you with free acess to study materials which should grant you elementary knowledge of HTML, CSS, DevTools and others.</br>
       You can also check the author of the page here on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bleedingdev/">here</a> and also check out his GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/BleedingDev">GitHub</a>

      <h2>Jak se st√°t testerem - 3 month course by Radek Kitner</h2>
      <p> On my journey I also decided to participate in 3 month course led by Radek Kitner where he taught us the basics of testing. <br> </p>
      <h3> What I learned:</h3>
      <p> Creating test cases
      <br> Writing them down into TestRail
      <br> Reporting bugs into Jira
      <br> Basic commands in SQL  
      <br> SCRUM metology
      <br> Types of testing and where to use them
      <br> API testing in Postman
      <br> Examining network traffic by using Wireshark
      <br> And used DevTools as well</p> <br>
      <p> The course itself was mostly practical where we tested certain webs, not only learned about it. </p>

      <br>
      <h2>GEN Academy (Avast) - ISTQB preparatory course</h2>
      <p> I was given the opportunity to partitipate on a preparatory course of ISTQB CTFL finished by the exam</p>
      <h3> What I learned:</h3>

      <br> Tool Support for Testing
      <br> In the end I also could practice testing on a special app where we could use black-box testing, static testing and exploratory testing Techniques
      </p>
      
      <br>
      <h2>Jak automatizovat testy</h2>
