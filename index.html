      <h1> My tester journey </h1><br>
      <h2> Where I learned about DevTools</h2>
      <h2> Khan Academy </h1>
      
      <p> so far this kind of project is a overlook of the basics of DevTools according the Khan Academy study materials. <br>
      More about the materials can be found at: <a href="https://cs.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/using-the-browser-developer-tools">Khan Academy</a> </p
  
     <h2> NaucmeIT </h2>
     
     <p> there should be ment to say the materials on Khan Academy were recommended at <a href="https://naucme.it/">NaucmeIt</a>. At this website I proceed further in the tester course. <br>
       Both webpages provide you with free acess to study materials which should grant you elementary knowledge of HTML, CSS, DevTools and others.
