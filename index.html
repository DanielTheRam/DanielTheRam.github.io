      <h1> My journey how to become a tester</h1><br>

      <p> This kind of a project servs as an overview for me where I studied all the things about testing I know so far. </p>
      <h3> Places where I studied so far:</h3>
      <h2> Khan Academy </h2>
      
      <p> To be able to create this HTML/CSS file I had to study the basics of it. In my opinion it is also helpful for testing any webpages. I was taught the basics for free at Khan Academy - find the link down bellow.<br>
      More about the materials can be found at: <a href="https://cs.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/using-the-browser-developer-tools">Khan Academy</a> </p>
  
     <h2> NaucmeIT </h2>
     
     <p> There should be ment to say the materials on Khan Academy were recommended at <a href="https://naucme.it/">NaucmeIt</a>. At this website I proceed further in the tester course. <br>
       Both webpages provide you with free acess to study materials which should grant you elementary knowledge of HTML, CSS, DevTools and others.</br>
       You can also check the author of the page here on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bleedingdev/">here</a> and also check out his GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/BleedingDev">GitHub</a>

      <br> Examining network traffic by using Wireshark
      <br> And used DevTools as well</p> <br>
      <p> The course itself was mostly practical where we tested certain webs, not only learned about it. </p>

      <br>
      <h2>GEN Academy (Avast) - ISTQB preparatory course</h2>
      <p> I was given the opportunity to partitipate on a preparatory course of ISTQB CTFL finished by the exam</p>
